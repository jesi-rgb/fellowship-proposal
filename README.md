# Processing Fellowship 2023

Hi! We are Greg and Jesús, two developers based in Denver, CO and Jaén, Spain, eager to participate in 2023's Processing Fellowship.

We present here our work as well as our proposal, consisting of a mathematical engine built on top of p5.js

# Proposal

We propose a mathematical engine for the web, similar to tools that are already out there like Manim, Desmos and alike. Building it natively for the web means unparalleled levels of accessibility. We believe that learning is making, and as such, we aim to provide a sensible and robust framework for students and teachers to build upon, making it easy for everyone to engage with mathematical edeavours in a computational context.
